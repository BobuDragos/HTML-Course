            the desire to build my own 3D open-world experiences is what 
            (at about 9yrs old) brought me into writing my first 
            <code class="text-light bg-dark">debug.log("Hello World")</code>. 
          </p>

          <p>
            i loved programming so much that (at about 17) i started teaching it.
          </p>

          <p>
            around the same age i've started doing freelance work. 
            i had clients, meetings and deadlines.
          </p>

            nowadays my main focus had been finalizing my research paper.
            The bachelors programme i've recently followed taught me
            on how many computer science areas are there and how uniquely facinating
            each of them can be.
